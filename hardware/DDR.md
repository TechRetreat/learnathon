# Dance Dance Revolution

## What you'll make
  I'm sure most of you have heard of the game Dance Dance Revolution. It involves a mat with four directional arrows,
  which you have to step on in time to the music and scrolling arrows on screen. There are also audio-only versions
  where the speaker calls out a sequence of arrows to follow.

## What you'll need
- **Arduino** - a progammable microcontroller; the brains of the project
- **Velostat** - this is a black sheet of packaging material that can be used to make pressure sensors
    <br>*or*<br>
- **Force sensitive resistor** - applying pressure to the disc changes its electrical resistance
- **Breadboard** - a prototyping tool used to make temporary connections
- **LEDs** - small, energy-efficient lights
- **Acrylic** - plastic squares to be used for the arrows
- Alligator clips, wires, etc.

## Vocabulary

## Instructions
1. <a href="part1.md">Your first Arduino program</a>  <!-- TODO: Make a simple blinking LED program; setting up the IDE and basic I/O -->
2. <a href="part2.md">Reading analog sensors</a>      <!-- TODO: Change blinking speed of LED proportionately to pressure; teach analog reads and basic circuit design -->
3. <a href="part3.md">Let's get physical</a>          <!-- TODO: Wire up 4 pressure sensors in parallel, attach to underside of acrylic squares -->
4. <a href="part4.md">Putting it all together</a>     <!-- TODO: Extend the code to read in all sensors and print which ones are pressed (debounced) -->

## Next Steps
  Now that you've built your dance mat, there are a few ways you can turn this hardware into an actual game.
  Choose one of the following next steps to start working on it:
- <a href="led_matrix.md">Physical version (LED matrix)</a> <!-- TODO: use an LED matrix to represent arrows scrolling up; play music with a piezo -->
- <a href="c++_ddr.md">Computer version</a> <!-- TODO: make a more traditional-style DDR game on a computer; play music from speakers -->

## Extend it further
  <!-- Bullet point ideas to inspire learners to extend & personalize their projects -->

- Add scores & display them
- Upload your own music & randomly generate arrows
- Team up and build multiplayer support
